1. Entry criteria: Look for consolidation patterns followed by breakouts with increased volume

3. Position sizing: Consider allocating no more than 2-5% of your portfolio to any single position
4. Exit strategy: Take partial profits at 10-15% gain, move stop loss to breakeven

Remember that all trading strategies involve risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.`
